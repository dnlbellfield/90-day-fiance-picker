## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Through JavaScript we have the ability to manipulate the DOM. Every single time you click on a button, the app is going to render the change through javascript and can see the change to the HTML in the browser.

## Lessons Learned:
Create a list, a ul in the HTML file
Then add an eventlistener / onclick Event for each "li" list item in the JavaScript File.
Each list item will be a couple you can "pick".

when you click an element with an id of a couples name

document.getElementById('kim-usman').onclick = kimUsman

A function should be listening for an event, the run the function with the same couple name 

kimUsman()

Then when the click event happens on the li element, this function, or any couplesName function kimUsman(), calebAlina() will run and change the background and add an image of the couple, the couples name, location, age, and story should also render to the page. 

I hope you found it enetertaining or fun.

The DOM API allows for  quick and efficient builds, it's a great tool for frontend/ UI experience!
The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. Usually it refers to JavaScript.

A document containing HTML is described using the Document interface, which is extended by the HTML specification to include various HTML-specific features. In particular, the Element interface is enhanced to become HTMLElement and various subclasses, each representing one of (or a family of closely related) elements.
